# Kata: Grade book

### Problem Description

Complete the function so that it finds **the average of the three scores** passed to it and returns the letter value associated with that grade.

Numerical Score Letter Grade

    90 <= score <= 100      'A'
    80 <= score < 90        'B'
    70 <= score < 80        'C'
    60 <= score < 70        'D'
    0 <= score < 60         'F'

Tested values are all between 0 and 100. Theres is no need to check for negative values or values greater than 100.

    gradeBook(95,92,93) === "A"
    gradeBook(85,81,89) === "B"
    gradeBook(75,71,78) === "C"
